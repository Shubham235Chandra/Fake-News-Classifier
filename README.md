# Fake-News-Classifier

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`fake_news.ipynb`) for analyzing and detecting fake news. The notebook uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to classify news articles as fake or real.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For generating visualizations (Note: If you're running the notebook in Jupyter, use `%matplotlib inline` to display plots inline).

## Dataset

The analysis is performed on the `WELFake_Dataset.csv` dataset, which is part of a larger collection of datasets available for fake news classification. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/fake-news-classification). This dataset should contain features and labels for news articles, where each article is classified as fake or real.
